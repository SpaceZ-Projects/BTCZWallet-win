**BitcoinZ Full Node GUI Wallet (Windows OS)**

BitcoinZ Full Node Wallet GUI is a full-featured, privacy-focused cryptocurrency wallet that allows you to securely store, manage, and interact with BitcoinZ (BTCZ) through your own local full node.

This application manages a locally installed BitcoinZ full node, meaning it downloads, maintains, and syncs the full blockchain directly on your device. This ensures that all transactions are verified independently, without relying on any third-party servers.

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Full Node Management**: Installs and manages a local BitcoinZ full node, providing complete transparency, decentralization, and security.
- **Tor Network Support**: Route wallet and node communications over the Tor network to enhance privacy and resist network-level surveillance or censorship.
- **Shielded and Transparent Transactions**: Send and receive BTCZ using both transparent and private (shielded) addresses.
- **Encrypted Memos**: Communicate securely via BitcoinZ’s shielded memo feature for private messages attached to transactions.
- **Built-in Mining**: Mine BTCZ directly from the wallet using your computer’s GPU, and view mining statistics in real-time.
- **Live Market & Network Stats**: Connects to public APIs such as CoinGecko and pool operators to display live price, hash rate, and other metrics.
- **Local Marketplace via Tor Service**: Create and host your own private market locally, accessible through a Tor hidden service. List items and services, and invite your contacts to visit your market securely. All data is stored and served locally, with no central server involved.

## ⚠️ Important Notice

> This project is still in progress. New features and updates will be added over time.

This wallet manages and maintains a full copy of the BitcoinZ blockchain, which may consume significant disk space, memory, and network bandwidth. 

You are **solely responsible** for backing up your wallet data and private keys. **Loss of this data may result in permanent loss of access to your funds.**

By using this software, you support the decentralized mission of BitcoinZ and take full ownership of your blockchain node and wallet security.
