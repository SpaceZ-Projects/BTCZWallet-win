**BitcoinZ Full Node GUI Wallet (Windows OS)**

BitcoinZ Full Node Wallet GUI is a full-featured, privacy-focused cryptocurrency wallet that allows you to securely store, manage, and interact with BitcoinZ (BTCZ) through your own local full node.

This application manages a locally installed BitcoinZ full node, meaning it downloads, maintains, and syncs the full blockchain directly on your device. This ensures that all transactions are verified independently, without relying on any third-party servers.

- **Built-in Mining** – Mine BTCZ directly from the wallet using your GPU and monitor live mining statistics.  
- **Market & Network Stats** – Fetch live BTCZ price, network hash rate, and other metrics via public APIs (e.g., CoinGecko, pool operators).
  
- **Local Tor Services** – Run secure services directly from your wallet through Tor:  
  - **Private Marketplace** – Host your own local marketplace as a Tor hidden service. List items/services and invite trusted contacts to visit. All data is stored locally, with no central servers.

## ⚠️ Important Notice

> This project is still in progress. New features and updates will be added over time.

This wallet manages and maintains a full copy of the BitcoinZ blockchain, which may consume significant disk space, memory, and network bandwidth. 

You are **solely responsible** for backing up your wallet data and private keys. **Loss of this data may result in permanent loss of access to your funds.**

By using this software, you support the decentralized mission of BitcoinZ and take full ownership of your blockchain node and wallet security.
